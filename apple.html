        An apple is a round, edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus spp., among them the domestic or orchard
        apple; Malus domestica). Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus
        Malus. The tree originated in <mark> Central Asia,</mark> where its wild ancestor, <em
            style="color: aqua;">Malus sieversii</em>
        have been grown for thousands of years in Eurasia and were introduced to North America by <strong>European
            colonists.</strong>
        Apples have <b>religious</b> and <b>mythological</b> significance in many cultures, including <b>Norse,
            Greek,</b> and
        <b>European Christian</b>
        tradition.<br>
